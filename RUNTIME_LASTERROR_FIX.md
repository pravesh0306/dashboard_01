# Runtime LastError Fix - Message Port Closed

**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Issue**: `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üö® Problem Description

The application was experiencing browser console errors with the following message:

```
v2:1 Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.
```

**Root Cause**: This error commonly occurs when a Chrome extension attempts to communicate with its background script or service worker, but the port is closed before the response is received. This happens due to:

1. Extensions being updated or reloaded
2. Background scripts being suspended to save memory 
3. Race conditions in extension communication
4. Extension messaging conflicts

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

Updated `extension-conflict-handler.js` to specifically handle these Chrome extension-related errors:

### Added Error Pattern Detection

```javascript
knownErrorPatterns: [
  // ...existing patterns...
  { pattern: /runtime\.lastError.*message port closed/i, source: 'Chrome-Extension' },
  { pattern: /Unchecked runtime\.lastError/i, source: 'Chrome-Extension' }
],
```

## üîç Technical Details

These patterns will capture both specific "message port closed" errors and general "Unchecked runtime.lastError" messages from Chrome extensions. The extension conflict handler will:

1. Intercept these errors before they appear in the console
2. Prevent them from disrupting user experience
3. Include them in error suppression statistics
4. Allow legitimate application errors to still pass through

## üìã Testing Verification

- Verified that the error is properly caught by the extension conflict handler
- Confirmed that application functionality remains intact
- Ensured that legitimate errors still appear in the console

## üîÑ Note on Chrome Extensions

This issue is common with various Chrome extensions and doesn't indicate any problem with our application. The fix prevents console spam while maintaining full application functionality.
