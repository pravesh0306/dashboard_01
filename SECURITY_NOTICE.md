# Security Notice

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: API Key Security Alert

**Date**: July 2, 2025
**Issue**: Google OAuth Client ID Exposure
**Status**: RESOLVED

### What Happened
During development, a Google OAuth Client ID was temporarily exposed in backup files and documentation. This has been cleaned up and secured.

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Removed all exposed Client IDs from active files
2. ✅ Replaced with placeholder `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` 
3. ✅ Cleaned up backup files containing sensitive data
4. ✅ Updated documentation to remove exposed credentials

### Current Security Status
- ✅ No API keys or Client IDs are exposed in the current codebase
- ✅ All sensitive values are now placeholders requiring user configuration
- ✅ Repository is clean and ready for public deployment

### For Production Use
If you were using the previously exposed Client ID:
1. **Generate a new Google OAuth Client ID** in Google Cloud Console
2. **Replace the placeholder** in `google-drive-storage.js`
3. **Follow the setup guide** in `GOOGLE_DRIVE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

### Best Practices Implemented
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys in source code
- ✅ Use environment variables or user configuration for sensitive data
- ✅ Regular security audits of codebase
- ✅ Proper .gitignore for sensitive files

---
**Note**: The exposed Client ID was for development/testing purposes only and has been invalidated. The current codebase is secure and production-ready.
