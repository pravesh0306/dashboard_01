## 📦 Future Deployment Guide

### Pre-Deployment:
- [ ] Verify all HTML files include proper CSS references
- [ ] Check all file paths use relative references correctly
- [ ] Run browser compatibility checks on CSS
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness at different breakpoints

### During Deployment:
- [ ] Ensure all CSS files are copied to the correct location
- [ ] Verify the manifest.json file is at the root level
- [ ] Check polyfills.css is included in the deployment

### Post-Deployment:
- [ ] Test the live site on multiple browsers
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness on real devices
- [ ] Check the console for any JavaScript errors
- [ ] Validate all critical UI components are displaying correctly

## 🛠️ Browser Compatibility

The site should now work correctly on:
- Chrome/Edge (latest versions)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)

## 📱 Responsive Design

The following breakpoints are now properly supported:
- Small: < 640px (mobile phones)
- Medium: 640px - 768px (tablets/small tablets) 
- Large: 768px - 1024px (tablets/small laptops)
- XL: > 1024px (desktop)

## 🚀 TailwindCSS Usage

While the project uses TailwindCSS-like classes, we've now standardized how they're loaded:
1. All pages load the same main.css (containing TailwindCSS utilities)
2. Component-specific styles are in dashboard.css
3. Mobile-specific styles are in mobile.css
4. Browser compatibility fixes are in polyfills.css
